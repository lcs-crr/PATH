Make sure to run the scripts in this folder in a separate environment with Python version 3.9.
The original paper provides no `requirements.txt` file, so we have provided our own. 

The working script is `tsadis.py`, which is very similar to the `3_inference.py` and `4_evaluation.py` scripts for the other approaches.
Functions are located in the `helper_functions.py` script, which are accessed by tsadis.py.
